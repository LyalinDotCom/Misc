* April 2020 | When you're using XAML Hot Reload what is your primary physical debug monitor setup for the running app and Visual Studio? For example on my wide screen I dock VS on the left and the app on the right side-by-side (SxS)

**2019**

* Oct 2019 | Hey XAML WPF/UWP devs a Q -- XAML IntelliSense today only triggers if you start typing something that starts with < vs. C# triggers on any first letter. Your opinion if this difference makes sense or should we consider a change? (disclaimer: we might not be able to change this)

* Jan 2019 | Hey friends! do you work on WPF applications today for your day or side job? or maybe do you have plans to start one? I'd love to know about it and I might ask you some questions. Please vote + reply if you don't mind me saying hi later.
